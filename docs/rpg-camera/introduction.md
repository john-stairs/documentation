# Introduction

This asset is a replica of the vanilla World of Warcraft (and similar RPGs) camera controller. In addition to the available features back then, I have implemented occlusion handling for fading out/in objects between the camera and your character.

It is developed in Unity and can be bought from their Asset Store: [RPG Camera](https://johnstairs.com/rpg-camera/buy.html) (affiliate link).

!!! info
    There is also a Lite version of this asset available in the store, as well as an upgrade to also have complementary character controls (see [RPG Cameras & Controllers](../rpg-cameras-and-controllers/introduction.md)).

# Roadmap

Since I am developing in Unity for fun, I cannot provide a real roadmap like some of you might wish. Nevertheless, below you can find my todo list and feature requests.

Note that nothing is set in stone *when* they are implemented and if they will ever make it into the asset. Especially in the last months, my private life was quite demanding and the time for Unity decreased. Bug fixes are an exception of course! They will be fixed as soon as possible.

- Jumping from free climbing
- Dodge Roll/Dash
- uMMORPG integration
- Game Creator 2 integration
- Controlled sliding, e.g. on icy surfaces

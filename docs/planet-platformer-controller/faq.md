# Frequently asked questions

## Why do I get so many errors?

The reason could be a wrong setup. Please set up everything according to the manual. Use the demo scene to verify that everything is set up correctly.

## Can I use a gamepad with your asset?

Yes, this asset was programmed for gamepads and uses Unity's Input System. Just rebind the PPInputActions to your needs.

## Where is the cool astronaut prefab?

The player and NPC models and their animations are not part of this asset. They were kindly provided by [Rheedo Animations](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/25499) for the purpose of the demo.

## Why are the provided animator and the animations not working?

The animations which are used in the provided animator are only dummy animations. They are named after Rheedo's animations which were used for the demo so that you can easily map them.

## Why does the movement on some objects, e.g. half-pipes, feel unintuitive?

Generally, it is an issue between perception and how the input is mapped. The original, Super Mario Galaxy, has actually the same "problem". You can work around this by making the half-pipe bigger to give player longer time to adopt the controls or turn camera slightly so that the X axis of the camera is not parallel to the character’s up vector.

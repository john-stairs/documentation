# Project Setup

Find the asset in Unity's Package Manager (Window > Package Manager) and press "Import".

    This asset is using Unity's Input System. If you are using a version below Unity 6, a warning pops up on import stating that the asset has Package Manager dependencies. Press "Install/Upgrade" to install missing dependencies including Unity's Input System. If you have not had the latter in your project activated already, another warning will show up asking you to activate it.

Now you are all set to already run the provided demo scene.

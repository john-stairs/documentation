# Integrations to other assets

This asset features some integrations to other assets which are available in Unity's Asset Store. Find out in their corresponding sections below how integration can be accomplished.

## RPG Builder

This asset provides an integration to Blink Studios' award-winning [RPG Builder](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/rpg-builder-177657). For setup instructions, please browse to Integration > RPGBuilder and go through the contained README file. There is also an [integration setup video](./videos.md) which guides through the steps.

## Mirror (or similar networking libraries)

Steps for simple Mirror integration – or other networking libraries which work similarly – are also provided. Unfortunately, there are some manual code corrections which have to be done by you as these are hard to provide out-of-the-box due to maintainability. But there are not many and they are all documented in a PDF document inside the folder Integration > Mirror.

# Introduction

This asset contains separate RPG camera and character controllers for MMO or Action RPGs. It is greatly inspired by famous MMO and ARPG games, like World of Warcraft or Zelda BotW.

It is developed in Unity and can be bought from their Asset Store: [RPG Cameras & Controllers](https://johnstairs.com/rpg-cameras-and-controllers/buy.html) (affiliate link).

!!! tip
    If you only want the camera logic, I also offer the modular [RPG Camera](../rpg-camera/introduction.md) as a separate asset. It can be upgraded to the RPG Cameras & Controllers asset anytime.

If any aspect is not simple enough described or missing, please contact me so I can improve the documentation.  In the following, the term \"character\" is used instead of the more general term \"engine object\". A character is an engine object, but an engine object is not necessarily a character.

They are game objects that consist of a Unity collider component and a gravitational field script. The former is set up as a trigger, the latter is distinguished as spherical, uniform or capsule. As the name suggests, spherical fields have a gravity vector towards their center, whereas the uniform fields' gravity vector always points into the same direction. The capsule field is a combination of both. You can enable gizmos for visualizing the field and its field lines per gravitational field.</p> <p>Each gravitational field has a priority and a gravity value.

Generally, a field with a higher priority wins over the other. If the priorities are the same, for each field a ray is cast from the character along the field lines detecting only hits with objects which have the \"Ground\" layer assigned. The Ground object whose surface is closest to the character game object wins. Note that this means that grounds and gravitational fields can act independently. After a strongest gravitational field is found, the gravity vector of that field is applied to the character game object. The direction of the gravity vector results from the field lines multiplied by the field's gravity.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>As the range and therefore the influence of a gravitational field depends on the attached collider size, it is recommended to leave the collider component scales to 1 and scale the whole gravitational field prefab instead for convenience.</p>"},{"location":"planet-platformer-controller/physics-engine/#character-alignment","title":"Character alignment","text":"<p>If the character is not grounded and a strongest gravitational field is found, the field's gravity vector at the position of the character is taken and a ray is cast in its direction.

A planet can have multiples of both. Planets can be simple objects like the provided prefabs inside folder \"Planets\" or complex with multiple ground objects and many gravitational fields. However, it is generally not recommended to overlap two different types of gravitational fields within one planet. If needed and depending on the use case, side effects can sometimes be overcome via assigning different field priorities. </p> <p>To group ground and gravitational field objects into one planet, unite them under a single root/parent object and assign the \"Planet\" component to it. Then, all children are together considered as one planet. Why is this important? Planets should represent smoothly connected objects that form something bigger.
